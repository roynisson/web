    <h2>Introduction to the Game</h2>
    <p>Rocket League, put plain and simple, is a game where you and otherplayers drifve around in cars for five minutes trying to score
    goals on the other team. It's intense, competitive, and really in depth, despite its simplicity on the surface. There are all types of different
    mechanics put into the game by the developers, keeping a game which seems like it might stagnate fresh. If you're thinking of playing it, it's free on the Epic Games store right now and forever. </p>
    <h2>My Experience with the Game</h2>
    <p>For starters, Rocket League is fun at any skill level. However, it is arguably oen of the most mechanically challenging games to pick up right now. Not only is it completely unique, there are about a million options you have for each play. People have even invented their own mechanics! However, despite it being an impossible game to master and being difficult to be good at, it's a very rewarding experience. Not only does winning and ranking up increase self-confidence and esteem,you can always get better. That's why I have played so many hours of this game; there's always a sense of genuine progression and improvement.</p>
    <h2>Rating and Reasoning</h2>
    <p>Rocket League is absolutely a once in a life time game. There is nothing like it, and the skill ceiling is the highest of any game I have ever played. It's difficult to pick up and to be good at, but makes up for this with real progression and improvement. It's a great game to play casually with friends, or to try as hard as possible and win games. I'm giving it a solid 9.2, with the one point being deducted due to general influence over the gaming scene; Rocket Leauge, despite being immensely popular and brilliant, hasn't really created any splashes or "waves" in the gaming industry. This is just about it's only fault.</p>
